## **The task submission workflow**

Fork → Clone → Branch → Implement → PR → Review

- Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
- Create a new branch for each Jupyter Notebook (e.g., task-1) if applicable (if there is any code that has to be implemented).
- Implement the solution based on the task descriptions.
- Push the branch to the forked repo.
- Create a Pull Request from the fork back to the main repo.
- Tag the learning support in Discord and we will review the PR and provide feedback through GitHub.
